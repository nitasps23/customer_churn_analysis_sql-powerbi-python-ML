### Churn Analysis Dashboard Project | Excel + Power BI + SQL + Machine Learning
> This project focuses on building a complete churn analysis using Excel, Power BI, SQL Server, and Python (Jupyter Notebook). It covers every phase from data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), through data modeling and visualization, to advanced machine learning model development to predict customer churn.

#### Project Breakdown:
> 1. **ETL Process in SQL Server:**
>    - Database, table, and view creation.
>    - Data cleaning and transformation using SQL queries.
>    - Removing NULL values and replacing them with cleaned data for further analysis.
> 2. **Power BI Data Transformation & Visualization:**
>    - Loading and transforming data within Power BI.
>    - Building a comprehensive data model.
>    - Creating measures and custom columns for accurate reporting.
>    - Designing intuitive visualizations to summarize churn insights.
>    - Advanced visualizations highlighting key trends, customer demographics, and service-related churn rates.
> 3. **Machine Learning Model – Random Forest:**
>    - Building a Random Forest model in Jupyter Notebook to predict churn.
>    - Preprocessing data, handling categorical variables, and splitting data into training/testing sets.
>    - Model training, evaluation using a confusion matrix, and feature importance analysis.
>    - Generating churn predictions for new customer data.
> 4. **Integration of Machine Learning and Power BI:**
>    - Importing churn prediction results into Power BI for visualization.
>    - Creating a "Churn Prediction Profile" to identify at-risk customers based on demographic, geographic, and service-level features.
>    - Presenting insights for targeted marketing campaigns and customer retention strategies.

#### Key Metrics & Goals:
> - **Churn Metrics:** Total churn rate, customer segments with high churn, service opt-outs.
> - **Customer Analysis:** Age group, gender, geographic distribution, payment methods, and services used.
> - **Prediction:** Identifying potential churners to reduce future churn through data-driven decisions.
